# No Redundant Comments in Frontend

**CRITICAL RULE**: Never add comments that simply restate what the code already clearly shows. Comments should explain **WHY**, not **WHAT**.

## What NOT to Comment

❌ **BAD** - Comments that restate the code:
```typescript
// Connect to the database
const sql = neon(DATABASE_URL);

// Insert the comment into the database
await sql`INSERT INTO comments...`;

// Check if it's an error
if (error) { ... }

// Get the user from state
const user = getUser();
```

✅ **GOOD** - Code is self-explanatory:
```typescript
const sql = neon(DATABASE_URL);
await sql`INSERT INTO comments...`;
if (error) { ... }
const user = getUser();
```

## When Comments ARE Acceptable

✅ **GOOD** - Comments that explain WHY or provide context:
```typescript
// Using Neon directly instead of Prisma because this is a standalone feature
const sql = neon(DATABASE_URL);

// Timeout is longer than proxy timeout to handle slow responses
const timeoutMs = 20000;

// Skip auth check for static assets to improve performance
if (pathname.startsWith('/_next')) return;
```

## Scope
This rule applies to ALL files in:
- `apps/web/**/*.tsx`
- `apps/web/**/*.ts`
- Any other frontend TypeScript/JavaScript files

## Enforcement
- Remove all comments that simply describe what the code does
- Keep only comments that explain WHY something is done a certain way
- If the code is unclear, improve the code itself rather than adding a comment
- Use descriptive variable and function names instead of comments
