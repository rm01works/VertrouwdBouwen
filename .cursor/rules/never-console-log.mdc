# Never Use console.log in Backend

**CRITICAL RULE**: Never use `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.info`, `console.debug`, or other `console.*` methods for general logging in the backend code (anything in `apps/api/`).

**Exception**: `console.error` is acceptable ONLY for legitimate, unexpected errors that need immediate attention. Do not use it for routine logging, debugging, or informational messages.

## Why?
- Console logging is synchronous and blocks the event loop, causing severe performance degradation
- Excessive console calls are not suitable for production environments
- It doesn't provide proper log levels, formatting, or structured logging
- It can't be easily filtered, monitored, or aggregated
- Debugging with `console.log` everywhere creates noise and makes real issues hard to find

## What to Use Instead
- Use a proper logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino, or similar) for all routine logging
- If logging is needed temporarily for debugging, use a proper logger with appropriate log levels
- For errors, prefer proper error handling and logging mechanisms over `console.error` when possible
- Consider using structured logging that can be easily parsed and monitored

## Scope
This rule applies to ALL files in:
- `apps/api/src/**`
- `apps/api/scripts/**`
- Any other backend TypeScript/JavaScript files

## Enforcement
When writing or reviewing backend code:
- Remove all `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.info`, `console.debug` calls
- `console.error` is acceptable only for legitimate, unexpected errors (not for routine logging)
- If logging is necessary, implement it using a proper logging solution
- Prefer structured logging over console methods even for errors when possible
